# Chapbook
Chapbook is a Kirby template for poets. It's not just for poets, anyone can use it.

The structure is easy to get to grips with and you can always  checkout the [Kirby website](http://getkirby.com/) for help customizing the template if you wish. Below you can find how to install and customize the theme. 

## Getting started
If you're not entirely familiar with Kirby, then it's best to quickly go through the following little guide: [Getting started](http://getkirby.com/docs/getting-started). After that download [Kirby](http://getkirby.com/downloads), unzip the contents and read the included readme.

You will now have a Kirby folder with a basic installation and its standard theme. From that folder delete the following **three** subfolders:  
- `/assets`  
- `/content `  
- `/site`  

Unzip Chapbook and copy over the following subfolders and files to the Kirby folder:  
- `/assets`  
- `/content`  
- `/site`  
- `favicon.ico`  

Great, you have all the files in place to be uploaded to your server.

If you're on a Mac, make sure Finder is set to show invisible files. You might miss the **.htaccess** file if you don't.
All there's left to do is upload the following files to your server:  
- `/assets`  
- `/content`  
-  `/kirby`  
- `/site`  
- `index.php`  
- `.htaccess`  
- `favicon.ico`  

## Modify

Chapbook comes with a couple of articles to get you on your way and to see how it's structured. It is as flat as possible.

You'll mostly be doing things in the `/content` folder. 

### Content
I recommend you read up on this primer first: [Adding content](http://getkirby.com/docs/content).

To modify the content in a poem open up it's main text file – **poem.txt** – which is located in the content-folder, i.e. `/content/01-the-pool/poem.txt`.

### Background Colors
Provided options are white, yellow, light_orange, blue_pink, and purple although you can always modify these or add new options in your styles.css file.

## Wrap up
I hope you enjoy using this theme, please let me know when you use it or have any questions. Have fun!
