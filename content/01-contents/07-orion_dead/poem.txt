Text: 

_[Artemis speaks]_
The cornel-trees
uplift from the furrows,
the roots at their bases
strike lower through the barley-sprays.

So arise and face me.
I am poisoned with the rage of song.

> _I once pierced the flesh
> of the wild-deer,
> now am I afraid to touch
> the blue and the gold-veined hyacinths?_

_I will tear the full flowers
and the little heads
of the grape-hyacinths.
I will strip the life from the bulb
until the ivory layers
lie like narcissus petals
on the black earth._

_Arise,
lest I bend an ash-tree
into a taut bow,
and slayâ€”and tear
all the roots from the earth._

The cornel-wood blazes
and strikes through the barley-sprays,
but I have lost heart for this.

I break a staff.
I break the tough branch.
I know no light in the woods.
I have lost pace with the winds.
